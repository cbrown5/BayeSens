#' Tools for prior sensitivity analysis with Bayesian MCMC models 
#'
#'  Approximates Hellinger distances between random draws from two distributions. Useful when the underlying distribution functions are unknown, for instance for use in prior sensitivity analysis for Bayesian MCMC models.  
#'
#' The \pkg{HellingerMCMC} provides functions for non-parametric calculation of the Hellinger distance, \code{\link{hellinger}}, parametric calculation of the Hellinger distnace \code{\link{hdistpara}}; data cloning with \code{\link{dataclone}}; and calculating posterior shrinkage with \code{\link{postshrink}}. Refer to the vignette for more help.
